Motivation and Rationale
Thermal sensing is emerging as a powerful and timely area of research, especially with the advent of low-cost, low-resolution thermal infrared array sensors. These sensors can detect heat signatures of people and objects without capturing identifiable visual details, offering a compelling privacy-preserving alternative to traditional cameras and even some wireless RF-based sensors. As recent work points out, conventional visible-spectrum cameras provide rich detail but at the cost of privacy, while radio-frequency (RF) sensing (e.g., Wi-Fi or radar) preserves privacy but with lower resolution. Thermal arrays promise an excellent middle ground, achieving a balance between sensing fidelity and privacy. For example, the TADAR system demonstrated that a single commodity thermal array can perform multi-person detection and ranging by extending 2D heat pixel data into 3D information. This illustrates that thermal sensors can capture useful spatial and activity information while inherently limiting sensitive visual data, extending beyond RADAR, LIDAR, SONAR, or WiFi RADAR sensing. 
Why now? Thermal imaging technology has recently become far more accessible. Miniature infrared array sensors (such as FLIR Lepton modules, Melexis microbolometer arrays, Meridian thermal sensors) are now affordable and easy to integrate into mobile and IoT devices. Researchers across multiple domains – mobile computing, human-computer interaction, computer vision, robotics, and localization – are beginning to explore thermal sensing as a new modality for ubiquitous computing.
Notably, heat-based sensing opens up opportunities to "see" in situations where traditional sensors fail (for example, in low-light or smoke-filled environments). At the same time, such thermal sensing can maintain privacy in sensitive settings like homes or workplaces. The community’s interest in this area is growing, as evidenced by a surge of recent research. One notable example is the Heat-Assisted Detection and Ranging (HADAR) technique, which was featured as a Nature cover story in 2023.
Given these developments, we believe it is timely to organize HotSense to consolidate efforts, foster collaboration, and shape the research agenda for thermal sensing in mobile and pervasive computing.
Workshop Goals and Topics
The primary goal of HotSense is to build and nurture a community around thermal sensing within the mobile and pervasive computing research field. We aim to bring together researchers from different disciplines — ranging from ubiquitous computing and wireless networks to computer vision, HCI, and robotics — to share their latest findings and brainstorm new ideas leveraging thermal sensors. By encouraging this interdisciplinary exchange, the workshop seeks to accelerate innovation in thermal sensing techniques and applications.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
Human activity recognition and gesture detection using thermal cameras or arrays
Pose estimation and people tracking via low-resolution thermal imaging
Thermal-based depth sensing, detection and ranging
Indoor localization and movement tracking with infrared thermal sensors
Robotic perception and navigation augmented by thermal vision
Privacy-preserving sensing systems that use thermal data instead of RGB video or RF signals
Material sensing and object classification
Scene temperature monitoring and its applications
Data fusion and multimodal sensing
Novel hardware designs and systems software for thermal sensing in mobile devices
Low-power and energy-efficient thermal sensing platforms and algorithms
Applications of thermal sensing in mobile health, smart homes, AR/VR, emergency response and smart cities
These topics underscore the relevance of thermal sensing to a wide array of mobile and ubiquitous computing scenarios. By covering everything from fundamental sensing techniques to end-to-end systems and applications, HotSense will attract a broad audience from academia and industry interested in exploring the potential of thermal sensing.
Planned Format
HotSense is planned as a half-day workshop on November 8, 2025 (co-located with ACM MobiCom 2025 in Hong Kong). The schedule will be designed to maximize interaction and discussion among participants. The tentative format and activities include:
Invited Keynote Talk: A distinguished researcher will kick off the workshop. We plan to invite Prof. Fanglin Bao (Westlake University) as the keynote speaker, who will present his recent “Heat-Assisted Detection and Ranging (HADAR)” work published in Nature. This keynote will set the stage by showcasing state-of-the-art thermal sensing research and inspiring new ideas.
Technical Paper Presentations: We plan to accept and present 5–10 peer-reviewed research papers. These will be organized into one or two sessions. Each paper will have a short presentation (15–20 minutes) followed by audience Q&A. The topics will span the areas listed above, ensuring a mix of novel hardware, algorithms, and applications.
Hands-on Tutorial Session: To foster learning and engagement, the organizers’ team will lead a tutorial on thermal sensing techniques and tools. This interactive session (approximately 30 minutes) will introduce participants to working with low-resolution thermal sensors (for example, demonstrating data collection with a thermal array and basic data processing). Attendees will gain practical knowledge, which is especially useful for those new to this domain.
Panel Discussion and Open Q&A: We will conclude with a moderated panel discussion featuring the keynote speaker, a couple of paper authors, and one organizer. The panel will address open challenges and future directions for thermal sensing and computing. Importantly, we will invite questions and ideas from the audience, facilitating a lively open forum. This discussion segment is intended to spark collaborations and identify key research questions, ensuring attendee involvement beyond passive listening.
Throughout the workshop, we will encourage an interactive atmosphere. In addition to formal Q&A after each talk, we plan to use mechanisms like a shared online Q&A board or live polls to gather questions and keep discussions active. The half-day format (approximately 4 hours including a coffee break) is compact yet sufficient to cover the content and enable networking among participants.
Expected Submissions and Participants
Given the rising interest in thermal sensing across multiple communities, we anticipate a healthy number of submissions and attendees for HotSense. We expect to receive on the order of 10–15 paper submissions in response to our call for papers. From these, around 5–10 high-quality papers will be selected for presentation (matching our session capacity).
In terms of participation, we estimate 30–50 attendees will take part in the workshop. This estimate is based on the attendance of similar niche workshops in recent years and the broad applicability of the topic. Participants will likely include researchers and practitioners from academia, industry R&D labs, and possibly government labs, who are working on or interested in sensing technologies. We also foresee interest from some MobiCom main conference attendees who are curious about exploring thermal sensing as a new research direction. The expected audience size will create an intimate setting conducive to interaction, while still being large enough to ensure diverse perspectives.
As this is the first edition of HotSense, there are no previous workshop statistics to report. However, the organizers will leverage their networks and MobiCom’s platform to ensure we reach the target audience and meet (or exceed) these participation expectations.
